LINEARMODELS: this py file contains both classification as well as the regression approaches to predicting the correct author, including preprocessing and transforming columns into appropriate representations/encodings
In linearmodels a set of experimented classifiers, but ultimately not used, is also imported for insight purposes or if you want to quickly try another classifier in the code.

BASELINE: Majority (surname) baseline model + first name retrieved when searching baseline model

CHECK DISTRIBUTIONS: checking distributions of the numerical data, used for deciding if to impute missing values with median or mean
